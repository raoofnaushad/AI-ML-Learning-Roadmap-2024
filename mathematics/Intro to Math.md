### Let's Understand What These Mean

#### Linear Algebra
Think of linear algebra as the language of data. We use vectors and matrices to organize and represent data. This helps machines understand and process information effectively. It's like giving your computer a map to follow.

#### Calculus
Calculus is all about change and movement. In machine learning, it helps algorithms learn and improve by adjusting their parameters. Concepts like derivatives and gradients guide models to better understand the data we've mapped out with linear algebra.

#### Probability & Statistics
Probability and statistics are the decision-makers. They help models handle uncertainty and make predictions. For example, in generative AI, they decide which word or token should come next. They are essential for learning from data and dealing with randomness.
