# Project Overview

This repository contains various resources and code examples related to key mathematical concepts and their applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## Contents

### Mathematics

1. **Linear Algebra**
   - [Linear Algebra Overview](mathematics/Linear%20Algebra.md)
   - Linear algebra is essential for understanding the objects optimized in machine learning. It uses vectors and matrices to organize and represent data, helping machines process information effectively.

2. **Intro to Math**
   - [Key Mathematical Concepts for AI/ML](mathematics/Intro%20to%20Math.md)
   - This document covers fundamental mathematical concepts such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability & Statistics, explaining their importance and applications in AI/ML.

### Code Examples

1. **LeetCode Solutions**
   - [Contains Duplicate](leetcode/ArraysListsSets/contains_duplicate.py)
   - This Python script checks if an array contains any duplicates using a hash set for efficient lookup.

   - [Maximum Subarray](leetcode/TwoPointers/maxmSubarray.py)
   - This Python script finds the subarray with the largest sum using a dynamic programming approach.

   - [Product of Array Except Self](leetcode/ArraysListsSets/product_array_except_self.py)
   - This Python script returns an array where each element is the product of all other elements in the input array, without using division and in O(n) time complexity.

### Miscellaneous

- **.gitignore**
  - The repository includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control, ensuring a clean and efficient workflow.
